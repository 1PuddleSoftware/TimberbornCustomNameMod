	WELCOME!
	These settings are for the CustomNameList mod. If you only have 1 save OR don't mind names rotating across saves, you can safely ignore these settings.
	However, if you want to track names uniquely per save, then you can use these settings to enable/manage names across multiple saves.
	-->

	<!--
        Setting Name: MultipleSaveMode
        Purpose: Use to track beaver names on a per save basis instead of a per computer basis.
        Note 1: This mode alters your save file directly. If you want to undo it later, you'll need the below options.
		Note 2: This mode currently doesn't work for bot names.
        Steps:
            1) Set MultipleSaveMode to true
            2) Load Timberborn with the CustomNameList mod on
        Result: Each save will track its own list of names from the baseline list that was uploaded.
        Valid values:
            true
            false 
    -->
	<MultipleSaveMode>false</MultipleSaveMode>
	<!--
        Setting Name: RestoreDefaultNameList
        Purpose: Use to reset the pool of names back to default.
        Notes: Existing beavers will keep their current name.
        Steps:
            1) Set ClearModNames to true
            2) Load Timberborn with the CustomNameList mod on
            3) Open your save
            4) Save your file again
        Result: Your save will be back to using the default name list from the Timberborn team.
        Valid values:
            true
            false 
    -->

        Setting Name: RefreshModNameList
		Once each name has been used once, the game will naturally refresh the list with the latest list of names.
        Purpose: You wish to see the list of custom names immediately on an existing save.
		OR you have added a lot of new names to the list that you want to see in the pool of names.
        Notes: Duplicate beaver names may occur temporarily since the list is completely refreshed.
        Steps:
            1) Set ClearModNames to true
            2) Load Timberborn with the CustomNameList mod on
            3) Open your save
            4) Save your file again
			5) Close your game
			6) Set RefreshModNameList setting back to false
        Result: Your save will now include the most recent list of names. Steps 5 & 6 will help reduce the number of long-term duplicates you see.
        Valid values:
            true
            false
